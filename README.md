#### Instructor: Paul Trebilcox-Ruiz

In this tutorial, you will learn about the BluetoothLeAdvertiser class, which enables developers to turn a supported phone into a Bluetooth LE beacon without the need for additional hardware. You will also learn how to scan for Bluetooth LE advertisement data so that you can react appropriately within your own applications.
